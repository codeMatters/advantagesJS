JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight and interpreted programming language having first-class functions(which means they are given the utmost priority over other objects in JS). It is mostly referred to as the scripting language for Web pages but nowadays it is also used by many non-browser environments(that execute JS out of the browser) such as Node.js, Adobe Acrobat, and Apache CouchDB.

Initially, JavaScript was called "LiveScript" but later its name got changed from LiveScript to JavaScript to sound more familiar. The main motive behind building JavaScript was to make web pages lively. Sounds interesting right ? Those were the times when there used to be no fancy(by fancy I mean more functional) web pages hence it was the need of the hour. The web pages without JavaScript are called "Static" web pages while those with JavaScript are "Dynamic" web pages. Dynamic web pages are very user-friendly and intuitive.
